SUMMARY
WORKING TIME REGULATIONS – Holiday Pay


1.  Payment for voluntary
overtime that is normally worked is within the scope of Article 7 and therefore
within the concept of ‘normal remuneration’ for the purposes of calculating
Regulation 13 holiday pay.

2.  It was open to the
Employment Tribunal in this case to conclude that the payments in issue were
part of normal remuneration for the Claimants, and no error of law was made
out.

3.  The appeal was accordingly
dismissed.






THE HONOURABLE MRS JUSTICE SIMLER DBE   (PRESIDENT)

Introduction
1.
This appeal raises an important issue affecting the level of holiday pay
for workers across the UK: namely, whether payments received in respect of entirely
voluntary overtime should be treated as forming part of a worker’s “normal
remuneration” for the purpose of calculating Regulation 13 holiday pay.

2.
The Employment Tribunal (Employment Judge Warren) decided that they
should, acknowledging in doing so that it was sailing into “uncharted waters”.
Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council who are the Appellants (but are referred to
as the Respondents for ease of reference) challenge that conclusion, submitting
that the decisions of the CJEU in two important cases,  British Airways Plc
v. Williams and Others  C-155/10  [2012] ICR 847  and  Lock v. British Gas
Trading Ltd  C-539/12  [2014] ICR 813  make clear that such payments should
not count as “normal remuneration” because they lack the necessary intrinsic link
to the performance of tasks required under the contract of employment.

3.
The appeal is resisted.  The Claimants, who are lead Claimants for a
group of 56 employees in the Respondent’s Directorate of Place responsible for
the repair and improvement of council-owned housing stock, contend on the
principal issue, in summary that:
(a)  the exclusion of payments
for “voluntary” work which is normally undertaken is inconsistent with the
overriding principal of EU case-law that normal remuneration must be maintained
so that pay in respect of annual leave “corresponds to” remuneration while
working. To exclude these payments results in financial disadvantage and deters
(or might deter) workers from taking annual leave;
(b)  in any event, there is, if
necessary, a link here between the payments and the performance of duties under
the contracts because, when working, these Claimants were required to work and
perform tasks required by their contracts.

The factual background and the Employment Tribunal’s decision
4.
The Claimants are employed in a number of different roles as electricians,
plumbers, roofers, storemen, operations officers and “Quick Response Operatives”
(who carry out general repairs).  They each have set contractual hours (for almost
all 37 hours per week) which represent their normal working hours.  Many have a
contractual right to 2-4 hours’ overtime.  Payment for this is not in dispute.

5.
In addition, they volunteer to perform additional duties which their
contracts of employment do not require them to carry out.  There is no dispute
in that regard that the on-call and additional overtime work is entirely voluntary
in the sense that they (the employees) can “drop on and off the rotas to suit
themselves whether day by day, week by week, month by month or permanently”
(paragraph 42 of the judgment).  As the Employment Tribunal held, this
additional work was “almost entirely at the whim of the employee, with no right
to enforce work on the part of the employer”.

6.
The following elements of pay for the additional voluntary hours worked are
in dispute in this case:
(i)  Out-of-hours standby pay;
(ii)  Call out allowance;
(iii)  Voluntary overtime; and
(iv)  Mileage or Travel Allowance
linked to the above.

7.
The Employment Judge referred to the CJEU’s judgment in  Williams ,
concluding that it required her to take into account anything “required of the
claimant under his contract of employment which is intrinsically linked to the
performance of the required tasks”, but to leave out of account “occasional or
ancillary costs”.  She referred to the Opinion of the Advocate General (also in
Williams ) that employees should suffer no disadvantage in taking leave
and must receive normal or average remuneration so as not to suffer a financial
disadvantage.  She concluded that regardless of the nature of the work, the
test is what normal pay is, having observed that loss of “pay” includes
“overtime”.  She applied that test to the facts of the case and dealt with each
element as follows:
(i)  At paragraph 47:
“ Out of hours
standby - has been paid to each of these claimants over a period of years, at a
rate of 1 week in 4 or 1 week in 5, with some variation when they swap on the
rota.  This may be a case therefore for an average payment to be calculated
individually.  I am satisfied though that although the work is entirely
voluntary it fits within the definition of normal pay, and to include it is
remuneration at times of annual leave is entirely within the requirements set
out by the CJEU and the Working Time Directive so as not to deter a worker from
taking leave.  To fail to pay it may deter a worker, who receives it
consistently and regularly, from taking leave ”
(ii)  At paragraph 48:
“Call out
allowances – it follows that if a worker is called out, he is being reimbursed
for the inconvenience of undertaking out of hours work.  Whilst this is a
voluntary rota, once on it he is, at the time, required to attend the call out
and this is intrinsically linked to the work required of him.  For example, he
is called out because he is a plumber in his day job, with the council.  The
payment reflects the antisocial nature of the work.  He is on the rota because
the respondent allows him to volunteer, an opportunity not available to every
employee.  This arises out of his employment and the remuneration he receives
is ‘normal’.    Normal pay is what is normally
received (per Mr. Justice Langstaff –  Bear   Scotland ”
(iii)  At paragraphs 50-54:
“Additional voluntary overtime
- Some of the employees undertake regular overtime – such that it will fit
within the definition of ‘normal pay’, others do not.  I apply the Advocate
General’s definition, which is adopted by the CJEU in  Williams.
51. Mr Woolvin – works regular
overtime which borders on the non-guaranteed as it is expected of him under his
job description.  I consider such to fall within normal pay.  This is not
unusual or rare, but regular”
52. Mr Pugh – is subject to voluntary
overtime provisions, but he advised the Tribunal that such overtime is very
rare, and as such this cannot be said to be part of his normal pay.
53. Mr Robertson and Mr Willetts are
unaffected by this type of voluntary overtime.
54. Mr Cree works regular Saturdays
and is paid overtime.  He sees it as an extension to his working week and he is
normally paid for it.  It falls within normal pay”.
(iv)  At paragraph 49:
“ Travel allowance   There is no
doubt that as this is paid at a rate higher than that recognised by the Inland
Revenue to be purely to recompense the cost of travel, there is an element of a
benefit in kind.  It is calculated on the mileage undertaken.  There is no
suggestion that it is designed to pay for the employee’s time, which is
reimbursed separately.  Part of this is clearly the equivalent of the train
ticket, the taxed balance is not.  I conclude that such part of the allowance
as is the subject of tax as a benefit in kind, is part of the claimant’s
‘normal’ pay in accordance with  Williams .  It is not designed to
recompense for expenditure, and it is subject to tax.  It is always payable if
mileage is undertaken in a private vehicle”

The legislative framework
8.
The Working Time Regulations 1998 (“the WTR”) were made under s.2(2) of
the European Communities Act 1972 to implement in domestic law the Working Time
Directive, now 2003/88/EC, originally 93/104/EC (“the WTD”).  Regulation 13
gives every worker an entitlement to four weeks’ annual leave, and together
with Regulation 13A, provides so far as relevant:
“13  Entitlement to annual leave
(1)  Subject to paragraph
(5), a worker is entitled to four weeks’ annual leave in each leave year.
(2)  …
13A  Entitlement to additional annual leave
(1)  Subject to Regulation
26A and paragraphs (3) and (5), a worker is entitled in each leave year to a
period of additional leave determined in accordance with paragraph (2).
(2)  The period of
additional leave to which a worker is entitled under paragraph (1) is –
(a)  …
(e)  in
any leave year beginning on or after 1 April 2009, 1.6 weeks.
(3)  The aggregate
entitlement provided for in paragraph (2) and Regulation 12(1) is subject to a
maximum of 28 days.”

9.
There is a distinction between the right to annual leave created by
Regulation 13 and the right to additional leave created by Regulation 13A.  The
former implements a right found in the WTD whereas the latter does not and is a
purely domestic measure.  The significance of the distinction is that any
entitlement to increased holiday pay premised on rights derived from EU law
applies only to Regulation 13 leave.  This appeal is concerned only with
payments of holiday pay relating to Regulation 13 holiday entitlement.

10.         The
right to annual leave in the WTR is discrete from the right to be paid in
respect of such leave.  The right to payment is created by Regulation 16(1)
which provides:
“A worker is entitled to be paid in
respect of annual leave to which he is entitled under Regulation 12 [and
Regulation 13A]. at a rate of a week’s pay in respect of each week of leave”
Regulation 16(2) specifies a method for calculating the rate of a
“week’s pay” by providing that ss. 221 to 224 of the Employment Rights Act 1996
(the “ERA 1996”) shall apply for these purposes (subject to certain
modifications of no relevance here).  These are complicated provisions.  They
work by seeking to divide employees into two broad categories: those who have
“normal working hours” and those who do not.

11.         The
category of employees with normal working hours sub-divides into three further
sub-categories:
(i)  Employees
whose remuneration varies according to the particular day or time they work
their normal hours;
(ii)  Employees
whose remuneration varies according to the amount of work that they do during
their normal working hours; and
(iii)  Employees
whose remuneration does not vary in the ways described immediately above.
Employees in the first two sub-categories have their “week’s pay”
calculated by, broadly, averaging their remuneration for normal hours over a
period of 12 weeks immediately preceding the calculation date if the employee
works throughout his normal working hours in a week (see ss.222(2) and
221(3)).  For the last sub-category, their “week’s pay” is:
“the amount which is payable by the
employer under the contract of employment in force on the calculation date if
the employee works throughout his normal working hours in a week” (s.221(2)).

12.         To
determine whether or not an employee has “normal working hours” it is necessary
to consider s.234 ERA 1996 which provides:
“(1)  Where
an employee is entitled to overtime pay when employed for more than a fixed
number of hours in a week or other period, there are for the purposes of this
Act normal working hours in his case.
(2)  Subject to subsection
(3), the normal working hours in such a case are the fixed number of hours.
(3)  Where in such a case –
(a)  the contract of
employment fixes the number or minimum number, of hours of employment in a week
or other period (whether or not it also provides for the reduction of that
number or minimum number in certain circumstances), and
(b)  that number of minimum
number of hours exceeds the number of hours without overtime,
the normal working hours are that
number or minimum number of hours (and not the  number of hours without
overtime)”.

13.         The
effect of s.234 is that if an employee has normal working hours (whether or not
their remuneration varies with the time at which the work is done or with the
amount of work done), overtime hours do not count when calculating a week’s pay
unless the contract itself fixes a number of overtime hours that must be
worked.  Since ‘fixed overtime’ hours are necessarily hours that the employer
is obliged to offer and that the employee is obliged to work, it is common
ground  that the relevant elements of pay in this case are not part of a
“week’s pay” under Regulation 16 WTR as a consequence of the deeming provision
in s.234 ERA 1996, which effectively excludes payments in respect of overtime
hours outside “normal working hours” from the domestic calculation of a week’s
pay no matter how regularly or frequently those additional hours are worked.  For
employees without normal working hours, their “week’s pay” is determined by
reference to a 12 week averaging calculation specified at s.224(2) ERA 1996.

14.         Accordingly,
on the face of the WTR and the ERA 1996, each of the Claimants would have
normal working hours but the payments in issue relate to hours which are not
normal working hours within s.234 ERA 1996 and therefore are not included in a
week’s pay for holiday pay calculation purposes.  However, it is common ground
on this appeal that a conforming interpretation of the WTR is possible in
accordance with the interpretive obligation required of domestic courts as
recognised in  Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA
(Case C-106/89)   [1990] ECR I-4135  (and see also in this context,  Bear
Scotland Ltd v Fulton   [2015] ICR 221  where Langstaff P held, at paragraph
66, that a conforming interpretation is possible in the context of
non-guaranteed overtime payments, as to which see further below).  In any
event, the provisions of Article 7 of the WTD are directly effective in this
case.  The question accordingly is the proper meaning and effect of Article 7
of the WTD, and whether the relevant elements of pay are within its scope.

15.         Article
7 of the WTD provides;
“Annual Leave
1.  Member States shall
take the measures necessary to ensure that every worker is entitled to paid
annual leave of at least four weeks in accordance with the conditions for
entitlement to, and granting of, such leave laid down by national legislation
or practice.
2.  The minimum period of
paid annual leave may not be replaced by an allowance in lieu, except where the
employment relationship is terminated.”

This has been described as a particularly important principle of
EU social law from which there can be no derogations: see  BECTU   [2001] ICR 1152  at paragraph 43.  The right to paid holiday is underpinned by Article 31(2)
of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.

16.         Neither
Article 7 nor the WTD more generally make provision in respect of the amount of
pay that is to be received during any period of annual leave.  However, in  Robinson-Steele
v R D Retail Services Ltd  C131/04 and C257/04,  [2006] ICR 932 , the ECJ held
(at paragraph 50):
“The term ‘paid annual leave’ in
[Article 7 (1) of the WTD] means that, for the duration of annual leave within
the meaning of the Directive, remuneration must be maintained.”

The question of what constitutes “normal remuneration” was not addressed
in  Robinson-Steele  but has been considered in the two cases since then
referred to above:  Williams  and  Lock .  In  Williams  the
relevant EU legislation was Directive 2000/79 (“the Air Crew Directive”),
rather than the WTD, but the questions referred to the Court extended to
Article 7 of the WTD and both the Advocate General and the CJEU held that the
same principles apply to both Directives: see paragraphs 39-43 (AG) and paragraphs
14-15 (CJEU).

17.         The
Air Crew Directive made provision for 4 weeks’ annual paid leave for mobile
staff in civil aviation.  Like the WTD, it was silent as to what pay components
should be included.  In calculating holiday pay, British Airways Plc left out
of account two payments:  Flying pay supplement and “Time Away from Base”
allowance.  Those were both payments which arose from the duties that the
claimant pilots could be required to perform by their contracts of employment
and did not relate to the undertaking of additional voluntary duties (whether
by way of non-guaranteed or voluntary overtime).

18.         In
her opinion Advocate General Trstenjak summarised the effect of  Robinson-Steele ,
stating (at paragraph 47) that it should be read as requiring that:
“the level of holiday pay must
correspond exactly to that of normal remuneration”.
That in her view was supported by reference to the ILO
Convention, C132, and  Stringer v Revenue and Customs Commissioners
[2009] ICR 932 , and at paragraph 51 she said:
“it is necessary to ensure in this
regard that the worker does not suffer any disadvantage as a result of deciding
to exercise his right to annual leave.  A prime example of such a disadvantage
is any financial loss which…would deter him from exercising that right.”

19.         The
Advocate General observed that while a member state could divide remuneration
into different components, an excessively narrow interpretation of what counts
as remuneration would carry the risk of employers declaring that individual
components do not count or fragmenting pay in such a way as to minimise levels
of holiday pay required to be paid.

20.         She
used as her starting point the definition of “pay” to be found in Article
141(2) of the Treaty (now Article 157), emphasising its broad definition and
that it has been found to include certain types of overtime payment (see
paragraph 77).  That wide definition covered payments representing direct
consideration for activities carried out by the pilots and indirect payments
for the activities performed that were compensatory in nature, for example, for
inconvenient working hours.  She concluded that the supplements at issue in  Williams
were material components of pay (see paragraph 79).  However, she also stressed
that the entitlement is only to “normal remuneration”, explaining that there is
a temporal component to that question and that “normal” can only refer to
something that has existed over a certain period of time and can be used as a
point of reference for comparison.  Both elements of pay satisfied this
requirement too and accordingly were within the concept of “normal
remuneration” for holiday pay calculation purposes.

21.         In
its judgment in  Williams  the CJEU endorsed the conclusion of the Advocate
General, following  Robinson-Steele,  that “remuneration paid in respect of
annual leave must, in principle, be determined in such a way as to correspond
to the normal remuneration received by the worker” (paragraph 21).  It held:
“19  In that context, the court has
already had occasion to state that the expressly “paid annual leave” in Article
7(1) of Directive 2003/88 means that, for the duration of “annual leave” within
the meaning of that Directive, remuneration must be maintained and that, in
other words, workers must receive their normal remuneration for that period of
rest: see Robinson-Steele v R D Retail Services Ltd (Jointed Cases C-131/04 and
C-257/04)  [2006] ICR 932 ; [2006] ECR 1-2531, paragraph 50, Stringer, paragraph
58.
20 The purpose of the requirement of
payment for that leave is to put the worker, during such leave, in a position
which is, as regards remuneration, comparable to periods of work: see
Robinson-Steele, para 58 and Stringer, para 60.
21 As the
Advocate General states in point 90 of her opinion, it follows from the
foregoing that remuneration paid in respect of annual leave must, in principle,
be determined in such a way as to correspond to the normal remuneration
received by the worker.  It also follows that an allowance, the amount of which
is just sufficient to ensure that there is no serious risk that the worker will
not take his leave, will not satisfy the requirements of European Union law .
22 However,
where the remuneration received by the worker is composed of several
components, the determination of that normal remuneration and, consequently, of
the amount to which that worker is entitled during his annual leave requires a
specific analysis.  Such is the case with regard to the remuneration of an
airline pilot as a member of the flight crew of an airline, that remuneration
being composed of a fixed annual sum and of variable supplementary payments
which are linked to the time spent flying and to the time spent away from base .
23 In that
regard, although the structure of the ordinary remuneration of a worker is
determined, as such, by the provisions and practice governed by the law of the
member states, that structure cannot affect the worker’s right, referred to in
para 19 of the present judgment, to enjoy, during his period of rest and
relaxation, economic conditions which are comparable to those relating to the
exercise of his employment .
24 Accordingly,
any inconvenient aspect which is linked intrinsically to the performance of the
tasks which the worker is required to carry out under his contract of
employment and in respect of which a monetary amount is provided which is
included in the calculation of the worker’s total remuneration, such as, in the
case of airline pilots, the time spent flying, must necessarily be taken into
account for the purposes of the amount to which the worker is entitled during
his annual leave .
25 By contrast,
the components of the worker’s total remuneration which are intended
exclusively to cover occasional or ancillary costs arising at the time of
performance of the tasks which the worker is required to carry out under his
contract of employment, such as costs connected with the time that pilots have
to spend away from base, need not be taken into account in the calculation of
the payment to be made during annual leave .
26 In that
regard, it is for the national court to assess the intrinsic link between the
various components which make up the total remuneration of the worker and the
performance of the tasks which he is required to carry out under his contract
of employment.  That assessment must be carried out on the basis of an average
over a reference period which is judged to be representative and in the light
of the principle established by the case law cited above, according to which
Directive 2003/88 treats entitlement to annual leave and to a payment on that account
as being two aspects of a single right: see Robinson-Steele, para 58 and
Stringer, para 60 .
27  That stated, it must also be
pointed out that the court has already held that an employee, working as a
purser for an airline company and transferred, by reason of her pregnancy,
temporarily to ground work, was entitled, during her temporary transfer, not
only to maintenance of her basic salary but also to pay components or
supplementary allowances relating to her professional status as an employee.
Accordingly, allowances relating to her seniority, her length of service and
her professional qualifications had to be maintained: see, to that effect,  Parviainen
v Finnair Ovi  (Case C-471/08)  [2011] ICR 99 ; [2010] ECR I-6529, para 73.
That case law also applies to a pregnant worker who has been granted leave from
work: see  Grassmayr v Bundesminister für Wissenschaft und Forschung
(Case C-194/08)  [2010] ECR I-6281 , para 65.”


22.         Lock
concerned the question whether normal remuneration for holiday pay purposes
should include an element to reflect commissions that formed a significant
element of earnings and that Mr Lock, a salesman, would have made had he not
taken holiday.

23.         In
his opinion Advocate General Bot observed that the CJEU’s analysis of the
situation in  Williams  enabled the court to lay down several criteria for
including or excluding as appropriate, certain components of pay as ‘normal
remuneration’ for annual leave pay calculation purposes.  He identified the
general rule that the structure of a worker’s remuneration cannot detract from
the right to maintenance of normal remuneration (paragraph 24).  He concluded
that a decisive criterion for including certain components would be where there
was an intrinsic link between the pay components and the performance of tasks
the worker is required to carry out under his contract of employment (paragraph
27).  Another criterion for inclusion in normal remuneration was identified as
pay components that relate to the personal and professional status of the
worker, for example, allowances relating to his or her seniority, length of
service or professional qualifications.

24.         Applying
the first of these criteria, the Advocate General considered the commission in  Lock
to be “normal remuneration”.  At paragraphs 31 to 33 he explained:
“31. The commission in question is
directly linked to the work normally carried out by Mr Lock under his contract
of employment… Moreover, such commission does in fact constitute remuneration
for the work Mr Lock has carried out himself.  The commission is therefore
directly linked to that worker’s own work within his undertaking.
32.  …although the amount of
commission may fluctuate from month to month … such commission is none the less
permanent enough for it to be regarded as forming part of that worker’s normal
remuneration. In other words, it constitutes a constant component of his
remuneration. …
33. In my view, an intrinsic link
does therefore exist between the commission received each month by a worker
such as Mr Lock and the performance of the tasks he is required to carry out
under his contract of employment…”

25.         The
Court reiterated the approach adopted in  Williams  (see paragraphs 26-31),
agreeing with the Advocate General and expressly endorsing his approach at
paragraphs 31 to 33.  The CJEU concluded that:
32. …the commission received by Mr
Lock is directly linked to his work within the company. Consequently, there is
an intrinsic link between the commission received each month by Mr Lock and the
performance of the tasks he is required to carry out under his contract of
employment.”

26.         In
terms of domestic authority, two decisions to which I was referred are relevant
though neither is determinative of the particular issues in this case.  In  Bear
Scotland Ltd v Fulton and another   [2015] ICR 221  the Employment Appeal
Tribunal (Langstaff P) was concerned with overtime identified and described as
“non-guaranteed overtime” (in other words overtime the employer is not obliged
to provide but if it is offered, the employee is obliged to perform it) and
whether payments for non-guaranteed overtime were normal remuneration within
the scope of Article 7 of the WTD.  Among the arguments advanced was an
argument advanced by  Bear Scotland  that overtime hours on a voluntary or
non-guaranteed basis are special hours attracting special remuneration which
was not part of ‘normal remuneration’ as it was not intrinsically linked to the
worker’s tasks under the contract because a worker has a right to refuse to
perform those tasks.  Such payments are not for carrying out duties under the
contract (paragraph 33B-C).  In rejecting this argument, the Employment Appeal
Tribunal held:
“44.  Despite the subtlety of many of
the arguments, the essential points seem relatively simple to me.  “Normal pay”
is that which is normally received.  As Advocate Genral Trstenjak observed in  Williams ,
there is a temporal component to what is normal: payment has to be made for a
sufficient period of time to justify that label.  In cases such as the present,
however, where the pattern of work is settled, I see no difficulty in
identifying “normal” pay for the purposes of EU law and accept that, where
there is no such “normal” remuneration, as average taken over a reference
period determined by the member state is appropriate.  Accordingly, the
approach taken in  Williams  is unsurprising.  The court in  Lock
looked for a direct link between the payment claimed and the work done.  In the
Hertel and Amec cases, the work was required by the employer.  On the evidence,
the employment tribunal was entitled to think it was so regularly required for
payments made in respect of it to be normal remuneration.
45.  In so far as the test seeks an
intrinsic or direct link to tasks which a worker is required to carry out
(stressing those last four words) it would be perverse to hold that overtime in
these cases was not.  In my view, therefore, article 7 requires and required
non-guaranteed overtime to be paid during annual leave.  I see no scope for any
such uncertainty as would persuade me to make a reference to the Court of
Justice”.

27.
The Employment Appeal Tribunal held that given the WTR were intended to
implement the WTD, and there was no intrinsic reason why holiday pay should
exclude payment for overtime worked where the worker was contractually bound to
work if required, even though his employer was not bound to offer it,
Regulation 16 could and should be construed so as to conform with Article 7.
The conclusion that a conforming interpretation is possible was challenged
unsuccessfully in the Court of Appeal in  British Gas Trading Ltd. v Lock
[2017] ICR 1  where the Court unanimously concluded that the WTR could and
should be interpreted as requiring commission earnings to be taken into account
when calculating holiday pay in that case, albeit making clear that its
judgment was confined to Mr Lock’s case.

28.         I
accept as Mr Jones QC submits that the workers in  Bear Scotland  had no
right to refuse to perform the overtime work offered to them, whereas in this
appeal the position is different. Furthermore, in rejecting this argument, the
Employment Appeal Tribunal did not decide (and was careful not to decide)
whether payments for voluntary overtime fall to be treated in the same way, in
other words, as normal remuneration for these purposes.

29.         The
question whether voluntary overtime pay should count as “normal remuneration”
was in issue in  Patterson v Castlereagh Borough Council   [2015] NICA 47 .
The NICA decided that such pay should count but the point of principle was not
fully argued, because it was conceded.  Although the judgment of the CJEU at
paragraph 24 of  Williams  was cited, there is no analysis of it at all by
the NICA.  I accept, as Mr Jones submits, that the decision is not binding on
this Appeal Tribunal and given the points to which I have just referred, cannot
have significant persuasive effect.

Ground 1: the scope of Article 7
30.         In
light of those authorities, Mr Jones submits that the CJEU has twice considered
whether particular payments should or should not be treated as “normal
remuneration” (albeit that on neither occasion were the payments concerned with
the performance of tasks that were voluntary).  On both occasions, in
determining what should count as “normal remuneration” and what should not
count, the Court used a criterion that expressly required an intrinsic link
between the payment and the performance of tasks that the worker is required to
carry out under his contract of employment.

31.         Mr
Jones submits that once it is accepted that only normal remuneration, rather
than all remuneration counts, a test is required to identify those components
of pay that count as normal remuneration and those that do not.  He relies on
paragraph 24 of  Williams  (read with paragraph 26) as setting the test
for what components of pay count as “normal remuneration”. The test, he
submits, requires an intrinsic link between the payment and the performance of
tasks that the worker is required to carry out under his contract of
employment.  That compulsory contractual language was repeated in  Lock
and is a critical feature of the test. Paragraph 24 having set out the test,
paragraph 26 of  Williams  describes how the national court should apply
that test, hence the wording at the beginning of this paragraph, “in that
regard”.  If paragraph 24 does not set the test it is difficult to see why the
concept of an intrinsic link is used and difficult to see why the Advocate
General in  Lock  referred to this as a “decisive criterion”.

32.         Moreover,
Mr Jones submits that it is unsurprising that the application of that test in  Williams
resulted in a conclusion that flying pay and “time away from base” pay are part
of normal remuneration.  Flying pay is intrinsically linked to the task
required to be performed by pilots under their contracts of employment and it
is in the nature of their employment to be inconvenienced by having to perform
such tasks.  There is also an obvious link in respect of “time away from base”
pay where the consequence of performing the flying task is to take the pilot
away from home.  This attracts payment allowances because spending time away as
a consequence of performing duties under their contracts puts pilots to
inconvenience.  The same is true of  Lock .  However in the case of
voluntary overtime the necessary requirement linking the payment to the
performance of tasks carried out under the contract of employment is missing.  Voluntary
overtime is not performed under the contract of employment but by reference to
a separate agreement between the parties.

33.         In
resisting these submissions, Mr Ford QC submits that the overarching principle
is that the purpose of this requirement is to ensure that workers benefit from
remuneration comparable to that paid in respect of periods of work; or to put
it another way, do not suffer any financial disadvantage as a result of taking
annual leave.  Because any financial disadvantage may deter a worker (subject
to de minimis principles) it is incompatible with the objectives of Article 7
to exclude pay for voluntary overtime from the calculation of pay for
Regulation 13 annual leave.

34.         Mr
Ford relies on the Opinions of the Advocates General and the Court in  Williams
and  Lock  as establishing that principle.  Accordingly, in addition to
basic pay, payment in respect of annual leave must include payments for any
“inconvenient aspect” linked to tasks a worker is required to carry out under
his contract ( Williams  at paragraph 24); payments for seniority, length
of service and professional qualifications ( Williams  at paragraph 27);
and payments by way of commission ( Lock  at paragraph 32).  These are all
illustrations of payments which necessarily fall within the overarching
principle established by these cases, and therefore within Article 7.  The
proper approach, he submits, is that in each case, the disputed payment must be
assessed in light of the objective of Article 7, which is to maintain normal
remuneration, as the analysis in both  Williams  and  Lock  shows.

35.         I
prefer the submissions of Mr Ford on this question.  My reasons follow.

36.         There
is no doubt that the right to paid annual leave is a particularly important
principle of EU social law, enshrined in Article 31(2) of the Charter.  There
is no provision for its derogation in the WTD.  Recital 6 to the WTD requires
account to be taken of the principles of the ILO Convention with regard to the
organisation of working time.  The ILO has adopted paragraph C132 which is the
source of the requirement that the full period of holiday to which a worker is
entitled should be paid at a rate that is “at least his normal or average
remuneration”.  There is also no doubt that payments in respect of overtime
(whether that be compulsory, non-guaranteed or voluntary), constitute
remuneration as a matter of domestic and EU law.

37.         EU
law requires that normal (not contractual) remuneration must be maintained in respect
of the four-week period of annual leave guaranteed by Article 7.  That
overarching principle means that the payments should “correspond to the normal
remuneration received by the worker” while working: see  Williams  and  Lock .
The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that a worker does not suffer a
financial disadvantage by taking leave, which is liable to deter him from
exercising this important right from which there can be no derogation.

38.         It
follows in my judgement, that the CJEU in  Williams , having expressly
endorsed the conclusion of the Advocate General at paragraph 90.2, did not
purport to set a narrower test at paragraph 24 of its judgment that would have
the effect of restricting the application of the overarching principle.

39.         Having
set out the overarching principle, the CJEU made clear that the division of pay
into different elements cannot affect a worker’s right to receive “normal
remuneration” in respect of annual leave.  In each case the relevant element of
pay must be assessed in light of the overarching principle and objective of
Article 7 which is to maintain normal remuneration so that holiday pay
corresponds to (and is not simply broadly comparable to) remuneration while
working (paragraphs 22 and 23).

40.         Further,
for a payment to count as “normal” it must have been paid over a sufficient
period of time.  This will be a question of fact and degree.  Items which are
not usually paid or are exceptional do not count for these purposes.  But items
that are usually paid and regular across time may do so.

41.         Read
in that light, paragraph 24 of  Williams  is unsurprising and simply
reflects the Court’s assessment of the specific payments at issue in that case
as examined in light of the overarching principle.  That is reinforced by the
reference to “inconvenient aspects” which were directly relevant to the two
payments at issue.  Paragraph 24 does not however, set a sole or exclusive test
of “normal remuneration” dependent on a link between pay and the performance of
duties undertaken under compulsion of the contract of employment.  Nor does it
restrict the application of the overarching principle.  If there is an
intrinsic link between the payment and the performance of tasks required under
the contract that is decisive of the requirement that it be included within
normal remuneration.  It is  a  decisive criterion but not the or the only
decisive criterion.  The absence of such an intrinsic link does not
automatically exclude such a payment from counting.  That is supported by the
fact that payments that are personal to the individual such as those relating
to seniority, length of service and professional qualifications also count for
normal remuneration purposes even though they are not necessarily linked to
performance of tasks the worker is required to carry out under the contract of
employment or to inconvenient aspects of such tasks.

42.         Mr
Jones’ argument places too much weight on the reference to tasks required to be
carried out under the contract of employment.  This was not an issue in  Williams
or  Lock.   In  Williams  the court was deciding whether the payments
were intrinsically linked to work done by the claimants for the employer or
whether they reimbursed expenses incurred by them; and not to whether the work
was compulsorily required under the contract or done on a voluntary basis.  Furthermore
at paragraph 32 of  Lock  in particular, the CJEU appears to treat work
within the company as synonymous with the performance of tasks required to be
carried out under the contract of employment.

43.         Furthermore,
the exclusion as a matter of principle of payments for voluntary work which is
normally undertaken would amount to an excessively narrow interpretation of
normal remuneration that gives rise to the risk of fragmenting of pay into
different components to minimise levels of holiday pay.  It would result in a
risk of a worker suffering a financial disadvantage that might deter him from
exercising these rights contrary to the underlying objective of Article 7.  It
would carry the risk identified by Advocate General Trstenjak of employers
setting artificially low levels of basic contracted hours and categorising the
remaining working time as “voluntary overtime” which does not have to be
accounted for in respect of paid annual leave.  This is not a fanciful but a
real objection to the Respondents’ argument as demonstrated by the current
proliferation of zero hours contracts.

44.         It
seems to me that applying the overarching principle established by the CJEU in  Williams
and  Lock , in a case where the pattern of work, though voluntary, extends
for a sufficient period of time on a regular and/or recurring basis to justify
the description “normal”, the principle in  Williams  applies and it will
be for the fact-finding tribunal to determine whether it is sufficiently regular
and settled for payments made in respect of it to amount to normal
remuneration.

45.         Accordingly,
the Employment Tribunal in the present case made no error of law in finding
that remuneration linked to overtime work that was performed on a voluntary basis
could be included in normal remuneration for calculating holiday pay.

46.         If
I am wrong and there is a requirement of an intrinsic link, the link is between
the payment in question and tasks which a worker is required to carry out under
his contract of employment, and I consider that this test is satisfied here.
Absent a contract of employment, the specific agreement or arrangement made for
voluntary overtime would not exist.  The duties or tasks carried out in either
case are the same.  It seems to me that the contract of employment constitutes
an umbrella contract in that sense.  Whatever the position in advance of a
particular shift, it seems to me that once the Claimants commenced working a
shift of voluntary overtime or a period of standby duty or callout, they were
performing tasks required of them under their contracts of employment even if
there was also a separate agreement or arrangement.  The payments made were all
directly linked to tasks they were required to perform under their contracts of
employment and, once those shifts or standby periods began, they were in no
different position from an employee who is required by his contract to work
overtime or be on standby or attend callouts.

Ground 2: callout allowances
47.         This
ground of appeal relates to the Employment Tribunal’s finding that callout
payments were linked to compulsory work because (a) once on the rota a worker
cannot refuse to attend a callout and/or (b) the Claimants were called out to
do the type of work ordinarily required of them: see paragraph 48 of the
judgment.

48.         Mr
Jones submits that this approach impermissibly erodes the distinction between
compulsory and voluntary work.  Applying approach (a) any voluntary work could
be considered compulsory, because a worker will always be required actually to
perform the tasks required of him if he is to receive remuneration for a
voluntary shift.  If there is compulsion it arises from a specific agreement to
work the additional hours and not the contract of employment.  Equally,
applying approach (b) would he submits render voluntary work compulsory
wherever it was the sort of work carried out ordinarily by that worker.  This
is likely to be the majority of voluntary work because when arranging overtime
or callout work employers will typically seek to deploy workers who are trained
for or accustomed to that type of work.  That does not mean the extra work is
“intrinsically linked” to the ordinary work.

49.         In
agreement with Mr Ford, and for the reasons already given, I do not accept the
premise of this argument.  The focus of the overarching principle derived from  Williams
is on the maintenance of normal pay; in other words, the pay that is normally
received by the worker when he or she is working.  The WTD draws no distinction
between work that involves tasks that are contractually required and those that
are done as a consequence of volunteering to be on standby or callout or working
overtime under other special or separate arrangements.  That is simply not its
focus.  In applying the intrinsic link test, the focus is on the link between
the payment and the performance of duties or work that is normally done within
the company or for the employer, to ensure no financial disadvantage as a
result of taking annual leave in the interests of a worker’s health and safety.
It would be inconsistent with the overarching principle to exclude payments
for ‘voluntary’ work that must be performed once the worker commences an
overtime shift or standby duty and that is normally worked, simply because they
are not required by the contract of employment.  The question in every case,
irrespective of the label put on the payment, is whether the payment forms part
of the worker’s normal remuneration.  If payments for voluntary shifts, standby
or callout payments are normally paid, they must be included in pay for holiday
leave to ensure that there is no financial disadvantage as a result of taking
such leave, irrespective of the source of the obligation to perform the work in
question.

50.         Nor
do I consider that there was any error in the Employment Tribunal’s reference
to the similarity of the work done on the rota or when called out as compared
with the work ordinarily required during normal contractual working hours.  It
seems to me that this was a relevant factor for the Tribunal to consider and as
Mr Ford submits, it reinforced the conclusion that the callout payments were
for work which was required of the Claimants under their contracts of
employment.  These workers were called out both because they are plumbers in their
day jobs and had volunteered to be on the out of hours rota.

Ground 3: out of hours payments
51.         The
Respondents contend that, even if contrary to ground 1 there is no principled
reason why remuneration linked to voluntary work cannot be included in the calculation
of holiday pay, nevertheless the Tribunal erred in law in holding that the out
of hours pay (both standby and callout pay) represented “normal pay”: see
paragraphs 47 and 48 of the judgment.

52.         Here
it is argued that the Tribunal wrongly conflated the concept of “normal” with
the concept of “regular”.  It is accepted that the out of hours work done by
the Claimants was broadly regular because they were on call for one week in
every four weeks or one week in every five weeks over a number of years.  However,
the Respondents contend that it does not follow that such work is normal
because the statute requires a tribunal to determine a worker’s remuneration in
a normal week.  Normal weeks for these particular workers were, on that basis,
weeks when they were not on call.  Mr Jones submits that a distinction must be
drawn between regular overtime performed every week or most weeks which does
form part of a normal week, and overtime that is performed, albeit regularly,
in only a minority of weeks.  The latter pattern of work gives rise to normal
weeks which are the majority of weeks without overtime and to extraordinary or
special weeks, where the worker performs overtime or is on call.  He submits
that remuneration earned in such special weeks is not part of normal
remuneration.  He contends that this distinction is consistent with the
underlying purpose of the WTD.  Workers typically take holiday in blocks of
one, two or perhaps three weeks.  If such a worker performs overtime on a
regular weekly pattern, he will necessarily be forgoing overtime by taking
holiday.  However where the overtime is performed less frequently, say once a
month, the worker may take holiday in between shifts of overtime so as to
retain all available opportunities to earn additional remuneration.  That, he
submits, is what happened in this case.  In these circumstances the Claimants
were not deterred from taking holiday.  They simply took it in between their
weeks on call and the effect of the Tribunal’s judgment is accordingly to overcompensate
them by paying them in respect of an opportunity that they have not missed.

53.         I
do not accept these arguments.  The focus in Article 7 is on normal
remuneration and not the normal working week.  As already indicated, whether a
payment is normal is a question of fact and degree.  Questions of frequency and
regularity are likely to play a part in determining whether a payment is normal
because a payment that is made on a regular basis suggests that it is a
“systemic component” of remuneration (see paragraph 86 of the Advocate
General’s Opinion in  Williams ) that is usually or normally paid.

54.         Moreover,
I see no difficulty in principle in concluding that a payment is normally made
if paid over a sufficient period of time on a regular basis, say for one week
each month or one week in every five weeks, even if it is not paid more
frequently or even each week.  These are questions of fact for a tribunal and
here, in my judgment, the Tribunal was entitled to find that pay for working on
this basis was part of normal remuneration.  It was neither exceptional nor
unusual.  Fluctuations in the amount paid would be catered for by the 12 week
average.

55.         Nor
do I accept that as a matter of law, if workers have the opportunity to take
annual leave in weeks with no overtime or out of hours shifts, this means they
are not deterred from taking holiday by the failure to include within normal
remuneration for paid leave pay for such overtime or out of hours shifts.  A
deterrent effect is inferred from a reduction in remuneration rather than from
actual evidence that a worker has not taken annual leave.  The real question is
whether normal remuneration is maintained in respect of annual leave guaranteed
by Article 7.  If it is not, a deterrent effect is presumed irrespective of the
opportunity the worker had to take annual leave at a different time or suffered
a financial loss as a result of taking annual leave when he or she did.

56.         So
far as the individual position of each Claimant is concerned, I accept Mr
Ford’s submission that the issue of individual loss was not before the Tribunal
and the Tribunal made no findings in this regard. It will be a question for a
future hearing whether each individual Claimant suffered loss as a result of
taking leave when he or she did. That will require a focus on issues such as
the working pattern of each individual, what they normally did and when at work
and what they would have earned if they did not take annual leave. I do not
read the judgment as having determined these issues.

Conclusion
For all these reasons and notwithstanding the clear and well
articulated arguments advanced by Mr Jones, the appeal is dismissed.  I am
grateful to both counsel for their assistance in dealing with this appeal.
