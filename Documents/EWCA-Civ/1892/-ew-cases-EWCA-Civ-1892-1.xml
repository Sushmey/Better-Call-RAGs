1892 Dec. 6, 7.

LINDLEY
, BOWEN
and A.
L. SMITH, L.JJ.

LINDLEY, L.J. [The Lord Justice stated
the facts, and proceeded:—] I will begin by referring to two points which were
raised in the Court below. I refer to them simply for the purpose of dismissing
them. First, it is said no action will lie upon this contract because it is a
policy. You have only to look at the advertisement to dismiss that suggestion.
Then it was said that it is a bet. Hawkins, J., came to the conclusion that
nobody ever dreamt of a bet, and that the transaction had nothing whatever in
common with a bet. I so entirely agree with him that I pass over this contention
also as not worth serious attention.
Then, what is left? The first
observation I will make is that we are not dealing with any inference of fact.
We are dealing with an express promise to pay 100 l.  in
certain events. Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you
will, here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly
unmistakable — “100 l.  reward will be paid by the Carbolic
Smoke Ball Company to any person who contracts the iufluenza after having used
the ball three times daily for two weeks according to the printed directions
supplied with each ball.”
We must first consider whether this was
intended to be a promise at all, or whether it was a mere puff which meant
nothing. Was it a mere puff? My answer to that question is No, and I base my
answer upon this passage: “1000 l.  is deposited with the
Alliance Bank, shewing our sincerity in the matter.” Now, for what was that
money deposited or that statement made except to negative the suggestion that
this was a mere puff and meant nothing at all? The deposit is called in aid by the advertiser as proof of his
sincerity in the matter — that is, the sincerity of his promise to pay this
100 l.  in the event which he has specified. I say this for
the purpose of giving point to the observation that we are not inferring a
promise; there is the promise, as plain as words can make it.
Then it is contended that it is not
binding. In the first place, it is said that it is not made with anybody in
particular. Now that point is common to the words of this advertisement and to
the words of all other advertisements offering rewards. They are offers to
anybody who performs the conditions named in the advertisement, and anybody who
does perform the condition accepts the offer. In point of law this advertisement
is an offer to pay 100 l.  to anybody who will perform these
conditions, and the performance of the conditions is the acceptance of the
offer. That rests upon a string of authorities, the earliest of which is
Williams v. Carwardine 4 B & Ad 621 , which has been followed by many other decisions upon advertisements
offering rewards.
But then it is said, “Supposing that the
performance of the conditions is an acceptance of the offer, that acceptance
ought to have been notified.” Unquestionably, as a general proposition, when an
offer is made, it is necessary in order to make a binding contract, not only
that it should be accepted, but that the acceptance should be notified. But is
that so in cases of this kind? I apprehend that they are an exception to that
rule, or, if not an exception, they are open to the observation that the
notification of the acceptance need not precede the performance. This offer is a
continuing offer. It was never revoked, and if notice of acceptance is required
— which I doubt very much, for I rather think the true view is that which was
expressed and explained by Lord Blackburn in the case of Brogden v. Metropolitan
Ry. Co. 2 App Cas 666, 691 — if notice of acceptance is required, the person who makes the offer
gets the notice of acceptance contemporaneously with his notice of the
performance of the condition. If he gets notice of the acceptance before his
offer is revoked, that in principle is all you want. I, however, think that the
true view, in a case of this kind, is that the person who makes the over shews
by his language and from the nature of the transaction that he does not expect and does not require
notice of the acceptance apart from notice of the performance.
We, therefore, find here all the
elements which are necessary to form a binding contract enforceable in point of
law, subject to two observations. First of all it is said that this
advertisement is so vague that you cannot really construe it as a promise — that
the vagueness of the language shews that a legal promise was never intended or
contemplated. The language is vague and uncertain in some respects, and
particularly in this, that the 100 l.  is to be paid to any
person who contracts the increasing epidemic after having used the balls three
times daily for two weeks. It is said, When are they to be used? According to
the language of the advertisement no time is fixed, and, construing the offer
most strongly against the person who has made it, one might infer that any time
was meant. I do not think that was meant, and to hold the contrary would be
pushing too far the doctrine of taking language most strongly against the person
using it. I do not think that business people or reasonable people would
understand the words as meaning that if you took a smoke ball and used it three
times daily for two weeks you were to be guaranteed against influenza for the
rest of your life, and I think it would be pushing the language of the
advertisement too far to construe it as meaning that. But if it does not mean
that, what does it mean? It is for the defendants to shew what it does mean; and
it strikes me that there are two, and possibly three, reasonable constructions
to be put on this advertisement, any one of which will answer the purpose of the
plaintiff. Possibly it may be limited to persons catching the “increasing
epidemic” (that is, the then prevailing epidemic), or any colds or diseases
caused by taking cold, during the prevalence of the increasing epidemic. That is
one suggestion; but it does not commend itself to me. Another suggested meaning
is that you are warranted free from catching this epidemic, or colds or other
diseases caused by taking cold, whilst you are using this remedy after using it
for two weeks. If that is the meaning, the plaintiff is right, for she used the
remedy for two weeks and went on using it till she got the epidemic. Another
meaning, and the one which I rather prefer, is that the reward is offered to any person who contracts the epidemic or
other disease within a reasonable time after having used the smoke ball. Then it
is asked, What is a reasonable time? It has been suggested that there is no
standard of reasonableness; that it depends upon the reasonable time for a germ
to develop! I do not feel pressed by that. It strikes me that a reasonable time
may be ascertained in a business sense and in a sense satisfactory to a lawyer,
in this way; find out from a chemist what the ingredients are; find out from a
skilled physician how long the effect of such ingredients on the system could be
reasonably expected to endure so as to protect a person from an epidemic or
cold, and in that way you will get a standard to be laid before a jury, or a
judge without a jury, by which they might exercise their judgment as to what a
reasonable time would be. It strikes me, I confess, that the true construction
of this advertisement is that 100 l.  will be paid to anybody
who uses this smoke ball three times daily for two weeks according to the
printed directions, and who gets the influenza or cold or other diseases caused
by taking cold within a reasonable time after so using it; and if that is the
true construction, it is enough for the plaintiff.
I come now to the last point which I
think requires attention — that is, the consideration. It has been argued that
this is nudum pactum — that there is no consideration. We must apply to that
argument the usual legal tests. Let us see whether there is no advantage to the
defendants. It is said that the use of the ball is no advantage to them, and
that what benefits them is the sale; and the case is put that a lot of these
balls might be stolen, and that it would be no advantage to the defendants if
the thief or other people used them. The answer to that, I think, is as follows.
It is quite obvious that in the view of the advertisers a use by the public of
their remedy, if they can only get the public to have confidence enough to use
it, will react and produce a sale which is directly beneficial to them.
Therefore, the advertisers get out of the use an advantage which is enough to
constitute a consideration.
But there is another view. Does not the
person who acts upon this advertisement and accepts the offer put himself to
some inconvenience at the request of the defendants? Is it nothing to use this ball three times daily for
two weeks according to the directions at the request of the advertiser? Is that
to go for nothing? It appears to me that there is a distinct inconvenience, not
to say a detriment, to any person who so uses the smoke ball. I am of opinion,
therefore, that there is ample consideration for the promise.
We were pressed upon this point with the
case of Gerhard v. Bates 2 E & B 476 , which was the case of a promoter of companies who had promised the
bearers of share warrants that they should have dividends for so many years, and
the promise as alleged was held not to shew any consideration. Lord Campbell's
judgment when you come to examine it is open to the explanation, that the real
point in that case was that the promise, if any, was to the original bearer and
not to the plaintiff, and that as the plaintiff was not suing in the name of the
original bearer there was no contract with him. Then Lord Campbell goes on to
enforce that view by shewing that there was no consideration shewn for the
promise to him. I cannot help thinking that Lord Campbell's observations would
have been very different if the plaintiff in that action had been an original
bearer, or if the declaration had gone on to shew what a société anonyme was,
and had alleged the promise to have been, not only to the first bearer, but to
anybody who should become the bearer. There was no such allegation, and the
Court said, in the absence of such allegation, they did not know (judicially, of
course) what a société anonyme was, and, therefore, there was no consideration.
But in the present case, for the reasons I have given, I cannot see the
slightest difficulty in coming to the conclusion that there is
consideration.
It appears to me, therefore, that the
defendants must perform their promise, and, if they have been so unwary as to
expose themselves to a great many actions, so much the worse for
them.

BOWEN, L.J. I am of the same opinion. We
were asked to say that this document was a contract too vague to be
enforced.
The first observation which arises is
that the document itself is not a contract at all, it is only an offer made to
the public.
The defendants contend next, that it is
an offer the terms of which are too vague to be treated as a definite offer,
inasmuch as there is no limit of time fixed for the catching of the influenza,
and it cannot be supposed that the advertisers seriously meant to promise to pay
money to every person who catches the influenza at any time after the inhaling
of the smoke ball. It was urged also, that if you look at this document you will
find much vagueness as to the persons with whom the contract was intended to be
made — that, in the first place, its terms are wide enough to include persons
who may have used the smoke ball before the advertisement was issued; at all
events, that it is an offer to the world in general, and, also, that it is
unreasonable to suppose it to be a definite offer, because nobody in their
senses would contract themselves out of the opportunity of checking the
experiment which was going to be made at their own expense. It is also contended
that the advertisement is rather in the nature of a puff or a proclamation than
a promise or offer intended to mature into a contract when accepted. But the
main point seems to be that the vagueness of the document shews that no contract
whatever was intended. It seems to me that in order to arrive at a right
conclusion we must read this advertisement in its plain meaning, as the public
would understand it. It was intended to be issued to the public and to be read
by the public. How would an ordinary person reading this document construe it?
It was intended unquestionably to have some effect, and I think the effect which
it was intended to have, was to make people use the smoke ball, because the
suggestions and allegations which it contains are directed immediately to the
use of the smoke ball as distinct from the purchase of it. It did not follow
that the smoke ball was to be purchased from the defendants directly, or even
from agents of theirs directly. The intention was that the circulation of the
smoke ball should be promoted, and that the use of it should be increased. The
advertisement begins by saying that a reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke
Ball Company to any person who contracts the increasing epidemic after using the
ball. It has been said that the words do not apply only to persons who contract
the epidemic after the publication of the advertisement, but include persons who
had previously contracted the influenza. I cannot so
read the advertisement. It is written in colloquial and popular language, and I
think that it is equivalent to this: “100 l.  will be paid to
any person who shall contract the increasing epidemic after having used the
carbolic smoke ball three times daily for two weeks.” And it seems to me that
the way in which the public would read it would be this, that if anybody, after
the advertisement was published, used three times daily for two weeks the
carbolic smoke ball, and then caught cold, he would be entitled to the reward.
Then again it was said: “How long is this protection to endure? Is it to go on
for ever, or for what limit of time?” I think that there are two constructions
of this document, each of which is good sense, and each of which seems to me to
satisfy the exigencies of the present action. It may mean that the protection is
warranted to last during the epidemic, and it was during the epidemic that the
plaintiff contracted the disease. I think, more probably, it means that the
smoke ball will be a protection while it is in use. That seems to me the way in
which an ordinary person would understand an advertisement about medicine, and
about a specific against influenza. It could not be supposed that after you have
left off using it you are still to be protected for ever, as if there was to be
a stamp set upon your forehead that you were never to catch influenza because
you had once used the carbolic smoke ball. I think the immunity is to last
during the use of the ball. That is the way in which I should naturally read it,
and it seems to me that the subsequent language of the advertisement supports
that construction. It says: “During the last epidemic of influenza many thousand
carbolic smoke balls were sold, and in no ascertained case was the disease
contracted by those using” (not “who had used”) “the carbolic smoke ball,” and
it concludes with saying that one smoke ball will last a family several months
(which imports that it is to be efficacious while it is being used), and that
the ball can be refilled at a cost of 5 s.  I, therefore,
have myself no hesitation in saying that I think, on the construction of this
advertisement, the protection was to enure during the time that the carbolic
smoke ball was being used. My brother, the Lord Justice who preceded me, thinks
that the contract would be sufficiently definite if you were to
read it in the sense that the protection was to be warranted during a reasonable
period after use. I have some difficulty myself on that point; but it is not
necessary for me to consider it further, because the disease here was contracted
during the use of the carbolic smoke ball.
Was it intended that the 100 l.  should, if the conditions were fulfilled, be paid? The
advertisement says that 1000 l.  is lodged at the bank for
the purpose. Therefore, it cannot be said that the statement that 100 l.  would be paid was intended to be a mere puff. I think it was
intended to be understood by the public as an offer which was to be acted
upon.
But it was said there was no check on
the part of the persons who issued the advertisement, and that it would be an
insensate thing to promise 100 l.  to a person who used the
smoke ball unless you could check or superintend his manner of using it. The
answer to that argument seems to me to be that if a person chooses to make
extravagant promises of this kind he probably does so because it pays him to
make them, and, if he has made them, the extravagance of the promises is no
reason in law why he should not be bound by them.
It was also said that the contract is
made with all the world — that is, with everybody; and that you cannot contract
with everybody. It is not a contract made with all the world. There is the
fallacy of the argument. It is an offer made to all the world; and why should
not an offer be made to all the world which is to ripen into a contract with
anybody who comes forward and performs the condition? It is an offer to become
liable to any one who, before it is retracted, performs the condition, and,
although the offer is made to the world, the contract is made with that limited
portion of the public who come forward and perform the condition on the faith of
the advertisement. It is not like cases in which you offer to negotiate, or you
issue advertisements that you have got a stock of books to sell, or houses to
let, in which case there is no offer to be bound by any contract. Such
advertisements are offers to negotiate — offers to receive offers — offers to
chaffer, as, I think, some learned judge in one of the cases has said. If this
is an offer to be bound, then it is a contract the moment the person fulfils the
condition.
That seems to me to be sense, and it is
also the ground on which all these advertisement cases have been decided during
the century; and it cannot be put better than in Willes, J.'s, judgment in
Spencer v. Harding. Law Rep 5 CP 561, 563 “In the advertisement cases,” he says, “there never was any doubt that
the advertisement amounted to a promise to pay the money to the person who first
gave information. The difficulty suggested was that it was a contract with all
the world. But that, of course, was soon overruled. It was an offer to become
liable to any person who before the offer should be retracted should happen to
be the person to fulfil the contract, of which the advertisement was an offer or
tender. That is not the sort of difficulty which presents itself here. If the
circular had gone on, ‘and we undertake to sell to the highest bidder,’ the
reward cases would have applied, and there would have been a good contract in
respect of the persons.” As soon as the highest bidder presented himself, says
Willes, J., the person who was to hold the vinculum juris on the other side of
the contract was ascertained, and it became settled.
Then it was said that there was no
notification of the acceptance of the contract. One cannot doubt that, as an
ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of an offer made ought to be notified to the
person who makes the offer, in order that the two minds may come together.
Unless this is done the two minds may be apart, and there is not that consensus
which is necessary according to the English law — I say nothing about the laws
of other countries — to make a contract. But there is this clear gloss to be
made upon that doctrine, that as notification of acceptance is required for the
benefit of the person who makes the offer, the person who makes the offer may
dispense with notice to himself if he thinks it desirable to do so, and I
suppose there can be no doubt that where a person in an offer made by him to
another person, expressly or impliedly intimates a particular mode of acceptance
as sufficient to make the bargain binding, it is only necessary for the other
person to whom such offer is made to follow the indicated method of acceptance;
and if the person making the offer, expressly or impliedly intimates in his
offer that it will be sufficient to act on the proposal without communicating acceptance of it to himself, performance
of the condition is a sufficient acceptance without notification.
That seems to me to be the principle
which lies at the bottom of the acceptance cases, of which two instances are the
well-known judgment of Mellish, L.J., in Harris's Case Law Rep 7 Ch 587 , and the very instructive judgment of Lord Blackburn in Brogden v.
Metropolitan Ry. Co. 2 App Cas 666, 691 , in which he appears to me to take exactly the line I have
indicated.
Now, if that is the law, how are we to
find out whether the person who makes the offer does intimate that notification
of acceptance will not be necessary in order to constitute a binding bargain? In
many cases you look to the offer itself. In many cases you extract from the
character of the transaction that notification is not required, and in the
advertisement cases it seems to me to follow as an inference to be drawn from
the transaction itself that a person is not to notify his acceptance of the
offer before he performs the condition, but that if he performs the condition
notification is dispensed with. It seems to me that from the point of view of
common sense no other idea could be entertained. If I advertise to the world
that my dog is lost, and that anybody who brings the dog to a particular place
will be paid some money, are all the police or other persons whose business it
is to find lost dogs to be expected to sit down and write me a note saying that
they have accepted my proposal? Why, of course, they at once look after the dog,
and as soon as they find the dog they have performed the condition. The essence
of the transaction is that the dog should be found, and it is not necessary
under such circumstances, as it seems to me, that in order to make the contract
binding there should be any notification of acceptance. It follows from the
nature of the thing that the performance of the condition is sufficient
acceptance without the notification of it, and a person who makes an offer in an
advertisement of that kind makes an offer which must be read by the light of
that common sense reflection. He does, therefore, in his offer impliedly
indicate that he does not require notification of the acceptance of the
offer.
A further argument for the defendants
was that this was a nudum pactum — that there was no
consideration for the promise — that taking the influenza was only a condition,
and that the using the smoke ball was only a condition, and that there was no
consideration at all; in fact, that there was no request, express or implied, to
use the smoke ball. Now, I will not enter into an elaborate discussion upon the
law as to requests in this kind of contracts. I will simply refer to Victors v.
Davies 12 M & W 758 and Serjeant Manning's note to Fisher v. Pyne 1 M & G 265 , which everybody ought to read who wishes to embark in this
controversy. The short answer, to abstain from academical discussion, is, it
seems to me, that there is here a request to use involved in the offer. Then as
to the alleged want of consideration. The definition of “consideration” given in
Selwyn's Nisi Prius, 8th ed. p. 47, which is cited and adopted by Tindal, C.J.,
in the case of Laythoarp v. Bryant 3 Scott , 238, 250 , is this: “Any act of the plaintiff from which the defendant derives a
benefit or advantage, or any labour, detriment, or inconvenience sustained by
the plaintiff, provided such act is performed or such inconvenience suffered by
the plaintiff, with the consent, either express or implied, of the defendant.”
Can it be said here that if the person who reads this advertisement applies
thrice daily, for such time as may seem to him tolerable, the carbolic smoke
ball to his nostrils for a whole fortnight, he is doing nothing at all — that it
is a mere act which is not to count towards consideration to support a promise
(for the law does not require us to measure the adequacy of the consideration).
Inconvenience sustained by one party at the request of the other is enough to
create a consideration. I think, therefore, that it is consideration enough that
the plaintiff took the trouble of using the smoke ball. But I think also that
the defendants received a benefit from this user, for the use of the smoke ball
was contemplated by the defendants as being indirectly a benefit to them,
because the use of the smoke balls would promote their sale.
Then we were pressed with Gerhard v.
Bates. 2 E & B 476 In Gerhard v. Bates 2 E & B 476 , which arose upon demurrer, the point upon which the action failed was
that the plaintiff did not allege that the promise was made to the class of which
alone the plaintiff was a member, and that therefore there was no privity
between the plaintiffs and the defendant. Then Lord Campbell went on to give a
second reason. If his first reason was not enough, and the plaintiff and the
defendant there had come together as contracting parties and the only question
was consideration, it seems to me Lord Campbell's reasoning would not have been
sound. It is only to be supported by reading it as an additional reason for
thinking that they had not come into the relation of contracting parties; but,
if so, the language was superfluous. The truth is, that if in that case you had
found a contract between the parties there would have been no difficulty about
consideration; but you could not find such a contract. Here, in the same way, if
you once make up your mind that there was a promise made to this lady who is the
plaintiff, as one of the public — a promise made to her that if she used the
smoke ball three times daily for a fortnight and got the influenza, she should
have 100 l. , it seems to me that her using the smoke ball
was sufficient consideration. I cannot picture to myself the view of the law on
which the contrary could be held when you have once found who are the
contracting parties. If I say to a person, “If you use such and such a medicine
for a week I will give you 5 l. ,” and he uses it, there is
ample consideration for the promise.

A. L. SMITH, L.J. The first point in
this case is, whether the defendants' advertisement which appeared in the  Pall Mall Gazette  was an offer which, when accepted and its
conditions performed, constituted a promise to pay, assuming there was good
consideration to uphold that promise, or whether it was only a puff from which
no promise could be implied, or, as put by Mr. Finlay, a mere statement by the
defendants of the confidence they entertained in the efficacy of their remedy.
Or as I might put it in the words of Lord Campbell in Denton v. Great Northern
Ry. Co. 5 E & B 860 , whether this advertisement was mere waste paper. That is the first
matter to be determined. It seems to me that this advertisement reads as
follows: “100 l.  reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company to
any person who after having used the ball three times daily for two weeks
according to the printed directions supplied with such ball contracts the
increasing epidemic influenza, colds, or any diseases caused by taking cold. The
ball will last a family several months, and can be refilled at a cost of 5 s. ” If I may paraphrase it, it means this: “If you” — that is one
of the public as yet not ascertained, but who, as Lindley and Bowen, L.JJ., have
pointed out, will be ascertained by the performing the condition — “will
hereafter use my smoke ball three times daily for two weeks according to my
printed directions, I will pay you 100 l.  if you contract
the influenza within the period mentioned in the advertisement.” Now, is there
not a request there? It comes to this: “In consideration of your buying my smoke
ball, and then using it as I prescribe, I promise that if you catch the
influenza within a certain time I will pay you 100 l. ” It
must not be forgotten that this advertisement states that as security for what
is being offered, and as proof of the sincerity of the offer, 1000 l.  is actually lodged at the bank wherewith to satisfy any
possible demands which might be made in the event of the conditions contained
therein being fulfilled and a person catching the epidemic so as to entitle him
to the 100 l.  How can it be said that such a statement as
that embodied only a mere expression of confidence in the wares which the
defendants had to sell? I cannot read the advertisement in any such way. In my
judgment, the advertisement was an offer intended to be acted upon, and when
accepted and the conditions performed constituted a binding promise on which an
action would lie, assuming there was consideration for that promise. The
defendants have contended that it was a promise in honour or an agreement or a
contract in honour — whatever that may mean. I understand that if there is no
consideration for a promise, it may be a promise in honour, or, as we should
call it, a promise without consideration and nudum pactum; but if anything else
is meant, I do not understand it. I do not understand what a bargain or a
promise or an agreement in honour is unless it is one on which an action cannot
be brought because it is nudum pactum, and about nudum pactum I will say a word
in a moment.
In my judgment, therefore, this first
point fails, and this was an offer intended to be acted upon, and, when acted
upon and the conditions performed, constituted a promise to pay.
In the next place, it was said that the
promise was too wide, because there is no limit of time within which the person
has to catch the epidemic. There are three possible limits of time to this
contract. The first is, catching the epidemic during its continuance; the second
is, catching the influenza during the time you are using the ball; the third is,
catching the influenza within a reasonable time after the expiration of the two
weeks during which you have used the ball three times daily. It is not necessary
to say which is the correct construction of this contract, for no question
arises thereon. Whichever is the true construction, there is sufficient limit of
time so as not to make the contract too vague on that account.
Then it was argued, that if the
advertisement constituted an offer which might culminate in a contract if it was
accepted, and its conditions performed, yet it was not accepted by the plaintiff
in the manner contemplated, and that the offer contemplated was such that notice
of the acceptance had to be given by the party using the carbolic ball to the
defendants before user, so that the defendants might be at liberty to
superintend the experiment. All I can say is, that there is no such clause in
the advertisement, and that, in my judgment, no such clause can be read into it;
and I entirely agree with what has fallen from my Brothers, that this is one of
those cases in which a performance of the condition by using these smoke balls
for two weeks three times a day is an acceptance of the offer.
It was then said there was no person
named in the advertisement with whom any contract was made. That, I suppose, has
taken place in every case in which actions on advertisements have been
maintained, from the time of Williams v. Carwardine 4 B & Ad 621 , and before that, down to the present day. I have nothing to add to
what has been said on that subject, except that a person becomes a persona
designata and able to sue, when he performs the conditions mentioned in the
advertisement.
Lastly, it was said that there was no
consideration, and that it was nudum pactum. There are two considerations here. One is the
consideration of the inconvenience of having to use this carbolic smoke ball for
two weeks three times a day; and the other more important consideration is the
money gain likely to accrue to the defendants by the enhanced sale of the smoke
balls, by reason of the plaintiff's user of them. There is ample consideration
to support this promise. I have only to add that as regards the policy and the
wagering points, in my judgment, there is nothing in either of
them.
Appeal dismissed.
